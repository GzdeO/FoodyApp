Hello everyone!

I have some exciting news to share with you all! I have completed the development of a recipe app using the Kotlin programming language. Adding Flavor with Technology! 📱🍔

📌 About the App
This project encompasses modern Android development technologies and includes the following components:

🧭 Navigation: Managing different screens and ensuring seamless navigation.
🏗️ MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Architecture: Ensuring clean and modular code design.
🌐 Retrofit: Retrieving recipe data from a remote API.
🗄️ Room: Storing and managing users' favorite recipes locally.
⏳ Lifecycle: Effectively managing the lifecycle of activities and fragments.
🖼️ Glide: Swiftly and efficiently loading recipe images.
🚀 Project Objective
This app aims to provide easy access to a variety of recipes. Users can explore popular recipes, view their details, and even save their favorite recipes. Throughout the development of this project, I not only enhanced my technical skills but also learned how to design a user-centered experience.

I hope you enjoy my project! I'm open to any feedback, suggestions, or comments. Thank you! 🙌👨‍💻
