Hello everyone!

Hello everyone!
I have some exciting news to share with you all! I have completed the development of a recipe app using the Kotlin programming language. Adding Flavor with Technology! 📱🍔


📌 About the App

This project encompasses modern Android development technologies and includes the following components:


🧭 Navigation | 🏗️MVVM | 🌐 Retrofit | 🗄️Room | ⏳ Lifecycle |🖼️ Glide

🚀 Project Objective :

This app aims to provide easy access to a variety of recipes. Users can explore popular recipes, view its details, you can save your favorite recipes. Also, you can watch the recipe video on YouTube.  Throughout the development of this project, I not only enhanced my technical skills but also learned how to design a user-centered experience. While creating this application, I utilized data from the TheMealDB API.

I hope you enjoy my project! I'm open to any feedback, suggestions, or comments. Thank you! 🙌👨‍💻
